# TechNodes Frontend

The frontend is implemented as a React application written in TypeScript, using the [Next.js framework](https://nextjs.org/).

* React is a stable, flexible, familiar frontend framework
* Most TechNotes traffic is expected to be reads of (relatively) static content, and Next.js excels at optimizing for that case with incremental server-side generation.
* Next.js has lots of developer-friendly features like live-editing/hot-reloading.
* Next.js abstracts away a lot of complexity like webpack and babel, which are annoying to maintain.
