# `app`

`app` contains generic code related to app startup, shutdown, configuration,
logging, and other generic application concerns.

Nothing in this folder is particularly specific to Neolace (other than the
details of 'config'), and nothing in here depends on any app code outside of
this `app` folder (in particular, no dependencies on `core`).
