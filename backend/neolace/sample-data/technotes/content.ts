                # Braden MacDonald, *CEO*

                Braden is a software developer and technology enthusiast. He is the co-founder and CEO of [TechNotes](https://www.technotes.org) and the CTO of [OpenCraft](https://opencraft.com/). Prior to TechNotes, Braden's most recent major project was [LabXchange](https://www.labxchange.org/), an online platform from Harvard University which provides world-class life sciences education materials to the world on-demand and for free. Braden led the software development for the project, which went on to have over two million users in its first year and won the 2020 Open edX Prize for creating the most impactful technical project built with Open edX.

                An avid programmer since childhood, Braden has worked with a wide variety of projects, platforms, and programming languages over the years. Braden is known for his deep technical knowledge, his wide-ranging experience, his approach to understanding problems from many perspectives, his ability to communicate clearly, and his relentless optimism.

                Outside of work, Braden has enjoyed serving on several non-profit boards, notably the OGO Car Share Co-op which brought car sharing to BC's Okanagan Valley and was acquired by [Modo](https://modo.coop/). Braden holds an Honours B.Sc. in Physics from the University of British Columbia.

            # Long-term Vision

            Our long-term vision is to build an authoritative, free, collaboratively developed online library of
            detailed and practical information about engineering and technology. This website would be somewhat
            analogous to Wikipedia or Wikidata, but focused entirely on technology and built with different content and
            capabilities.
            
            **Mission statement: to accelerate and protect humanityâ€™s technological advancement by providing a
            comprehensive, open, and practical library of technological knowledge.**

            # Goals

            The goals for this project are:
            
            1. To accelerate the pace of technological and scientific innovation

               *Humanity has a lot of knowledge about how to build amazing things, but much of it is not easily accessible - available only from specialist books, obscure research papers, internal corporate documents, and in-person instruction. This is especially true of the hard-won practical advice that is necessary to go beyond theory and actually build things yourself.*
            
            2. To make all of its information easily discoverable, cross-referenced, in standardized formats, and as accessible as possible

               *Here accessible means both to humans and to machines.*
            
            3. To promote standardization, collaboration, and open standards
            
            4. To create a single resource that contains enough in-depth engineering and technological information to build a modern technological civilization from scratch
            
               *If humans had to abandon earth and land on another habitable planet, TechNotes would provide the knowledge needed to quickly build mines, factories, power sources, habitats, and (eventually) things like smart phones. This scenario is hopefully never going to occur, but any resource which meets that aspirational goal would provide countless very real benefits here and now.*
            
            5. To collaboratively develop and publish open-source ready-to-use designs for important tools, devices, and technologies
            
               *If an engineer were asked to design a lightweight habitat that humans could live in on Mars, instead of having to design everything from scratch, her team could start by downloading complete plans for things like washing machines, lighting fixtures, microwaves, smoke detectors, door locks, etc., then modify them to be as simple and lightweight as possible, then print/order the components - creating a much more complete and functional habitat in a fraction of the time as would otherwise be possible. And of course, the community could continue to iterate on and improve these Mars design variants.*
            
            6. To preserve detailed knowledge of now-obsolete technologies
            
               *Why? For historical purposes, to avoid any loss of technological capability, to serve as inspiration for future discoveries, and to be used if needed to rebuild civilization after an apocalypse.*

                # Applications

                A single 18650 cell is often used as the rechargeable battery for flashlights and e-cigarettes.

                When combined together to create a multi-cell [battery](/entry/${ids.battery}), 18650 cells are used for:
                * power tools
                * e-bikes
                * electric vehicles
                * notebook computers (though today many notebooks use lithium polymer cells instead, which allow for a
                  thinner form factor)


                # In depth

                ## Protection circuits

                18650 cells are available as either "unprotected" or "protected" cells. The protected cells have a
                built-in circuit within the cell package that protects against potentially dangerous situations like
                over charges, over discharges, and short circuits - any of which can potentially lead the cell to
                burst, overheat, or catch fire.

                # Known issues

                ## Length variations

                Although the 18650 cell is a standard size (the dimensions in millimeters are in the name itself), cells
                with integrated [protection circuits](#h-protection-circuits) are often longer than the standard 65mm.
                Such protected cells usually fit in holders that use spring-loaded or flexible metal contacts, but other
                holder designs or battery pack formats may not fit them if they are designed for the standard 65mm
                length.
