description: >-
  Every [Entry](/entry/term-entry) has a friendly ID that uniquely identifies it. For example, the friendly ID of this {
  this } entry is **{ this.key }**. The friendly ID appears the in the URL of each entry - for example, the URL
  for this term ends with "/entry/{ this.key }". You can edit an entry to change its friendly ID. If you change
  the friendly ID for a given [Entry](/entry/term-entry), previously used friendly IDs will still continue to work and
  continue to point to the same entry.
