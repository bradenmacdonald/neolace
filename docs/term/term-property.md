description: >-
  A **property** is an attribute that specific [entries](/term/entry) can have, that provides a piece of information
  about each such entry in a consistent way. For example, an entry about "Canada" would state that it has a **Total
  Area** of "9,984,670 km^2^" - in this case, "Total Area" is the Property and "9,984,670 km^2^" is the [Property
  Value](/entry/term-property-value).
