description: >
  A VNID is the primary unique identifier for each object that Neolace uses.
  For example, every [Entry](/entry/term-entry) has a unique VNID, as does every
  Entry Type, every User, every Site, etc. A VNID is a type of
  [UUID/GUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
  encoded into a short string. As an example, the VNID of the entry that defines
  this term "VNID" in the documentation is `_7mZEPBfx2QFE1P8D9hKL3k`.
