  Every [Entry](/entry/term-entry) is of a specific **Entry Type**. The Entry Type determines what
  [properties](/entry/term-property) the entry can have (including what relationships to other entries it can have), as
  well as what type of content it can have (article text, image, attached files, etc.). This entry, { this }, has entry
  type { this.entryType() }. Entry Types are part of each [Site](/entry/term-site)'s [Schema](/entry/term-schema).
