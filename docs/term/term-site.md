  A **Site** in Neolace is a collection of knowledge or structured data. Each site has its own
  [Schema](/entry/term-schema) that defines what types of entries it has as well as the attributes and relationships
  that can exist for those entries. Each site also has its own collection of [Entries](/entry/term-entry) that comprise
  the actual content/data of the site. You are currently reading the **Neolace Documentation** site at
  **docs.neolace.com**, which is part of the larger Neolace.com [Realm](/entry/term-realm).
