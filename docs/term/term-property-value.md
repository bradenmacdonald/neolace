  A **property value** is the value that a [property](/entry/term-property) has for a specific
  [entry](/entry/term-entry). For example, an entry about "Canada" would state that it has a "Total Area" of **9,984,670
  km^2^** - in this case 9,984,670 km^2^ is the Property Value (for the "Total Area" [property](/entry/term-property)).
