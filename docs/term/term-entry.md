  An Entry is the core concept in Neolace. Each Neolace site is a collection of
  Entries. Every Entry has a **name**, **description**, **friendly ID**, and
  [VNID](/entry/term-VNID) (permanent unique ID). Entries can also have
  **properties** (which can include relationships with other Entries) and
  **content** (like articles, images, or files). Every Entry is of exactly one
  Entry Type, which defines what properties and content that Entry can or must
  have.
